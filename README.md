# Harry-Potter-Sorting-Hat-Quiz

“A thousand years or more ago,
When I was newly sewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known.”
The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry welcomes you! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony.

The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:

gryffindor
hufflepuff
ravenclaw
slytherin
